# Curi Dynamic Model

This repository contains the code to simulate the dynamic model of power grid with low inertia in a dq framework. 

The model is based on the following literature: 
 - [Control of low-inertia power grids: A model reduction approach](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8264521)
