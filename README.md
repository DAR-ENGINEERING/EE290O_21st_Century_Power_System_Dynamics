# LinDynamicModel

This repo contains files from a group project in EE290O "21st Century Power System Dynamics" taught as a graduate seminar course at U.C. Berkeley in Spring 2019. The matlab files are used to re-create portions of the inverter and machine model described in [1].

Inverter model:
PLL: main_testPLL.m, which runs the function testPLL.m
LCL: main_testLCL.m, which runs the function testLCL.m
LCL and current and power controllers: main_testLCLcontrollers.m, which runs the function testLCLcontrollers.m

Machine model:
main_testmachine.m, which runs the function testmachine.m

The group report is also uploaded here as 290O_FinalProject.pdf, "Modeling a Coupled Machine-Inverter System".
